                Dennis Johnson is in his mid 50's. He is a retired basketball
                professional, now working in insurance, and recently opened a second
                office for his growing independent insurance business. Dennis is a graduate of Pepperdine
                University where he majored in macro-biology and minored in 
                15th century literature. Being a part of the chamber of commerce helps Dennis connect with the local
                community.

                Tiffany Steele is in her late 20's. She runs a home-based business as a virtual 
                assistant. Her days vary greatly, and she enjoys the variety of activities she is asked
                to perform. In her spare time, besides her avid love of long distance running, Tiffany 
                spends time working at a local blood bank as a staffer, and she also volunteers at the 
                Children's Hospital in the pediatric cancer ward. The Chamber gives Tiffany a ready made list
                of potential clients for her services.
