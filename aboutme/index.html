        I've been married for 34 years, and have 6 children that are mostly
        adults. I've started 3 companies, and I spent 10 years in the Nuclear
        Health Physics industry. After that, I had a successful software career,
        with 22 years at Microsoft, and currently 3+ years at Tableau. I started
        as an engineer, and have been an engineering manager for 20 years.

        I became a member of the Church at age 19. I currently serve as the Ward
        Clerk for my ward. In the last decade, I've had the privilege to serve
        as the 1st Counselor in the Bishopric, the Ward Mission Leader, and
        Elder Quorum President.

        I have decided to pursue a degree through BYU-I because I left college
        at 19; I got a job as a programmer with a small company, and never went
        back. I'm completely self taught in Computer Science, and I expect that
        much of the 100 classes will be review for me. I look forward to filling
        in the gaps in my knowledge.

        In my spare time, I read, watch movies, and listen to my kids amazing
        musical talents.
