            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Site Name</h3>
            <p>https://www.bountiful-foods.com</p>

            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
            <p>Bountiful Foods is small business specializing in organic, locally grown foods. They are physically
                located in Carlsbad, California, however, they have many food trucks that cover the coastal area from
                Los Angeles to San Diego. The company sells fruits and produce directly from the farmers in the area,
                but also uses some national and international suppliers. The owner-operated company caters to walk in
                traffic at their storefront in Carlsbad and, of course, their food trucks. They deliver and manage those
                orders on the phone and via the website. The mission is to provide fresh and healthy food options,
                including organic, made to order, fruit drinks and fruit bags, to the local population and to tourists
                visiting the coastal areas. The theme should support healthy eating, organic bounty, and convenience.
            </p>

            <h3>coast copy</h3>
            <p>A vacation on the California coast is one much coveted by anyone looking to kick back, relax and enjoy the world famous beaches and beautiful weather. With a coastline spanning over 800 miles and hundreds of different beach towns to choose from, it can be tough to select just one for your trip, but there is one location that rises above the rest.</p>

            <p>Carlsbad, California is located in San Diego County, an easy half an hour drive north of Downtown San Diego. If you don’t like to drive or don’t have a car on your trip, don’t worry! Located in the heart of Carlsbad Village is a Coaster station where you can catch a train and ride straight to Old Town San Diego or to Downtown for a margarita or a night out. It’s a small town with big city flavor and conveniences. Carlsbad Village has all the aspects of a downtown you’re looking for complete with a fun bar scene and top notch restaurants.</p> 
                
            <p>With plenty of food, fun and friendly locals, the Village is the perfect place to spend you time. If you’re thirsty, head over and grab a rooftop drink for happy hour at the new Park 101 or a coffee at Vinaka Cafe. For lunch, why not snag a sandwich at Board & Brew and try to guess what’s in their secret sauce? With all of these options, you’ll never run out of fun cocktails to try or to-go lunches to grab on your way to the beach. And with seven miles of stunning coastline, you’ll never run out of sand, sun or breathtaking sunsets.</p>
                
            <p>Directly in front of our Carlsbad Beach Collection properties, you’ll see Tamarack State Beach. It’s flanked on it’s north and south by North Carlsbad Beaches, which stretch up to Oceanside, and Terramar Beach, a surfers haven, that runs into South State Beach and onto Ponto Beach at the very tip of south Carlsbad. Carlsbad State Beach consistently ranks as one of the top 25 beaches in the country according to Trip Advisor.</p>
                
            <p>This family friendly beach town is the ideal place to bring yourself and your kids to enjoy a stress-free trip. Without the hustle and bustle of Downtown San Diego or the craziness of Pacific Beach, but with all the culture and cuisine, Carlsbad Village is the place to be for your vacation.</p>
                
            <h3>organic locally grown copy</h3>
            <h4>The argument for buying local, organic food</h4>
            <p>The local food movement in America is growing. All over the country, in small towns and in big cities, people are starting to realize the very best fruits, vegetables, dairy and meats come literally from their own back yards. Nearly every town of any size now has farmer’s markets where people can come and buy produce, meat, dairy, baked goods and artisan crafts from their local farming community. This is more than just a “feel good” movement: there are some very sound reasons why buying local and organic is good for the farmer, the consumer and society as a whole.
                
                <h5>The Food is Healthy and Delicious</h5>
                <p>When you buy food that has been locally grown, you are generally buying a product that has been picked when it is ripe and usually picked within a day or two of the time you buy it. When you buy from a chain store, generally produce has been harvested while still unripe so that it will not spoil in shipping and it might be days or weeks between harvest and the time it lands on the shelves. The freshness of the food makes an enormous difference in the way it tastes.</p>
                
                <p>When you buy local organic or naturally grown foods, you are buying from farmers who sustain and nourish the soil naturally (meaning that the nutritional value of the food is higher) and do not use pesticides or herbicides that can leave residues on the food and work its way into your meals. These residues can bring with them a whole array of health problems that are best avoided.</p>
                
                <h5>Local Food is Kinder to the Environment</h5>
                <p>Buying local organic food means that you are financially supporting sustainable farming practices that commit to healthy soil, wise water usage, and refrain from the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticide and herbicides that can not only damage human health but lead to water and air pollution and poison wildlife. Since the average product on groceries shelves travels on average some 1,200 miles to reach you, shopping locally can also reduce gasoline usage for food transport and have a beneficial impact on greenhouse gas levels.</p>
                
                <h5>Buying Local Makes Economic Sense</h5>
                <p>There is also a strong economic reason for local buying practices. When you buy from your own area, you are helping to create and sustain jobs and to support family farms and small businesses that are right in your own community. You are also helping yourself economically by breaking the dependence that many have on big chain groceries stores.</p>
                
                <p>All these are excellent reasons why you should consider buying local organic food: it is tastes better, is healthier for you and your family, and is kinder to both the environment and the economy.</p>
